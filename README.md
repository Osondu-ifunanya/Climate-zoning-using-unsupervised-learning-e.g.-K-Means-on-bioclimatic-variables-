# 🌍 Climate Zoning using K-Means Clustering

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform climate zoning using unsupervised machine learning. Synthetic bioclimatic variables are generated to simulate environmental conditions. K-Means clustering is applied to categorize regions into distinct climate zones based on these variables.

## 🧪 What It Does

- Generates synthetic climate variables: temperature, precipitation, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed
- Scales data for uniform comparison
- Applies K-Means clustering to detect climate zones
- Exports labeled data with assigned climate zones to Excel

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy & Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for plotting)
- Excel export via `openpyxl`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn openpyxl
